        I'm a full stack web developer, problem solver, and builder of
        responsive web applications. I love learning and implementing new
        technologies, and I'm forever a student of tech. The web is one of the
        most exciting platforms ever created, and I use it to build performant
        and inclusive projects that enrichen and better people's lives. When I'm
        not coding, I enjoy travelling and fixing motorcycles!
